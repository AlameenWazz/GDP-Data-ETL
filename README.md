# GDP-Data-ETL
Extract, Transfrom and Load GDP Data

An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world recruited me as a junior Data Engineer and was tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.
